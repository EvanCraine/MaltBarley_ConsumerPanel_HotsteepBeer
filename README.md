Supporting data and R code for Craine et al., 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.15786)

R markdown files (.Rmd) feature the following statistical analyses:
    -analysis of variance (ANOVA) and visualization of effects
    -correlation between hot steep and beer liking
    -principal component analysis (PCA) of malt quality, hot steep and beer liking
    -analysis of check-all-that-apply (CATA) data using a contingency table, correspondence analysis, and visualization with symmetric and asymmetric biplots
    -correlation between hot steep and beer CATA, and between malt quality and liking/sensory attributes
    -text mining and visualization using open comments from beer tasting
    -consumer clustering based on demographics, consumption patterns, liking
    -analysis of rank data (Friedman's test with posthoc analysis using Nemenyi Test)
    -multiple correspondence analysis (MCA)
    -Cochranâ€™s Q-test and critical difference (Sheskin) procedure
